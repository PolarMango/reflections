What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates necessary files to start the repository. Needed to tell github to start keeping track of file changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers

The staging area seems to be a spot to temporarily place files before they are committed to the git. The working directory is the memory allocation in the local machine where all files in repository reside.

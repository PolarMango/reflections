When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When working on a team project. Different people may need to access the repository to add features independently. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  It could advantageous to have control and manually pull/commit changes when a new feature is complete. Having control over whe the features are deemed complete is beneficial to avoid incomplete or broken code on the remote.
